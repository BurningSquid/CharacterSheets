D6 Fantasy character sheet for roll20

Author: Austin Bailey 

Thanks to: Timothy O'Driscoll (D6 Star Wars Sheet) and Michael Kotsarinis (D6 Space Sheet).

This script is intended to be used with the roll20.net custom character sheet feature. In order to load this sheet,
copy the code from the .html and .css files and paste them into the respective areas in the "Custom Character Sheet" menu in Game Settings.  In order to assure that this worked, click the preview tab and see if the sheet shows up as seen in the pictures. 

I highly recommend using this with the Wild Dice API script if you plan on playing with the D6 system (https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/tree/master/WildDice).

Enjoy!
